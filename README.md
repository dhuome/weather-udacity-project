# Weather Journal App Project :cloud:

Project three of Udacity's Frontend Developer Nanodegree. 

## Overview
"This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI," according to the course.


For this project I used the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to obtain current weather information based on the user's zip code. The user can enter their zip code (US only) and feelings to generate a journal entry. This entry contains the current date, the temperature at the location entered, and the text entered by the user.

## Instructions

You'll need to install Node.js to run the app locally. It makes use of the following packages:

- clone the repository 
- run the `npm install` command


Once everything is in place, use this command to launch the app.

```
npm start
```
This will launch a local server. Proceed to `localhost:3000` in your web browser, and you're ready to go!
